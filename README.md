This is a Yelp search app using the Yelp API.

Time spent: A lot, but mostly on making the initial project from the video to work. I ran into some weired issues, which I spent a lot of time fixing. So, I didn't had enough time to actually do the other stuff look nice. What would help if along with videos, you could also post the projects in the running state (if you are sharing the whole process anyway)
I know the code should be refactored, and I know there are still some issues, but I thought it's better to submit what I got anyway
